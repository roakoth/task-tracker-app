# Next Challenge: Adding TailwindCSS

You may have noticed my application looks plain and not pretty. Well, there is an amazing tool called `Tailwind CSS` that will transform this application and make it look presentable and pretty. 

If you are new to `Tailwind CSS`, you do not need to worry, you can refer to its documentation here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation to get an overview of how it works. Then see how you can add it to an Astro project by referring to this reference: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/
